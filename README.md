# Foundation 6


## "The most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world." (or so they say)

### Why Use Foundation:

1. Semantic naming conventions
2. Grid System is easy to use
3. Mobile-friendly
4. Truly a foundation for css - not as many pre-made themes as Bootstrap, but very responsive to changes.
